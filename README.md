# Respect Women Button
Based on tweets by Twitter user Doc Wolverine ([@Doc_Wolverine](https://www.twitter.com/Doc_Wolverine)), this Flutter app is a simple yet expressive button for letting that sad man know he needs to show "more interest in someone than just in the anatomy of theirs that you want to use for your own pleasure".
Currently in [v1.0.0-beta](https://github.com/wilddogcode/respect-women-button/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta)
